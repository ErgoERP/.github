# ERgo

### Lightweight ERP system, designed to serve small businesses
#### Developed by Mason Ritchason ([@masonritchason](https://github.com/masonritchason)).

ERgo aims to create a more balanced, weildy ERP system for businesses that don't quite meet the needs of a classic at-scale ERP.

### Platform
At the core, ERgo is powered by ERgo Platform, a central workspace for ERP processes.

**Platform Features**
Sales funnel connection:
- At the front of Platform is a high quality sales funnel connection. With or without Integrations, ERgo users can easily convert sales orders and information into production ready data.
- With landmarks along the way, Sales teams can stay up-to-date with production processes, without the need for manual communications.
- When production is complete, an invoice and other accounting info can be automatically generated.

### Integrations
Extensibility is a cornerstone feature of ERgo, which is why we support several integration packages for common business applications.
- **Salesforce**
- **Intuit Quickbooks**
